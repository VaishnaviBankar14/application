<span className='text3'>And Pinch of Yum is my little corner of the internet!<br/>

I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Pinch of Yum. What started as a casual hobby over 14 years ago in 2010 while I was working as a fourth grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business (!!) that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month, with content that has been featured on The Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29, Brit + Co, POPSUGAR, Huffington Post, The Everymom, PureWow, and more.

  I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage. My favorite things in life are a big plate of pad Thai, sunny days, and going to the dog park.
